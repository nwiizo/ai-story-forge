# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI Story Forge is a Japanese-language framework for AI-assisted storytelling. It provides structured templates and methodologies for creating consistent characters and compelling narratives using generative AI tools.

**Important**: This is a documentation-only repository with no executable code. All content consists of Markdown templates and guides written in Japanese.

## Repository Structure

The project uses a clear template-based structure:

- `character-template/` - Character development templates and prompts
- `story-template/` - Story construction templates and techniques  
- `quality-check/` - Quality assurance checklists and common problems
- `resources/` - Supporting documentation on principles and workflows

## Development Workflow

Since this is a template repository:

1. **No build/test commands** - The project contains only Markdown documentation
2. **Version control**: Standard Git workflow with changes tracked via commits
3. **Language**: All documentation is in Japanese (日本語)

## Core Methodology

The framework implements:

1. **Three-layer character system**:
   - 不変コア (Immutable Core): Values that never change
   - 準安定層 (Semi-stable Layer): Elements that vary within limits
   - 可変層 (Variable Layer): Flexible scene-specific elements

2. **Phased story construction**:
   - Phase 1: Basic plot skeleton
   - Phase 2: Key scene identification
   - Phase 3: Detailed scene design

3. **Five-axis quality evaluation**:
   - Character consistency
   - Physical logic
   - Psychological naturalness
   - Readability
   - Emotional impact

## Working with This Repository

When modifying or extending this repository:

- Maintain the existing template structure
- Preserve the Japanese language for all documentation
- Follow the established naming conventions (CHARACTER.md, STORY.md, etc.)
- Keep examples in their designated `examples/` subdirectories
- Ensure any new content aligns with the five prompt engineering principles outlined in README.md

## Quick Reference

To get started with the templates:
```bash
cp character-template/CHARACTER.md my-character.md
```

The primary workflow involves:
1. Copying template files
2. Filling in structured information
3. Using the provided prompts with AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)
4. Iterating based on quality checks

Remember: This repository focuses on methodology and templates for creative writing, not code development.
