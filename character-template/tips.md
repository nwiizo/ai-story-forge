# Tips for Character Creation

## 🎯 Secrets to Success

### 1. Narrow down to one core value
- It's tempting to give multiple values, but this can confuse the AI.
- Derive other characteristics from one strong value.
- Example: "Sharing knowledge" → Kind, patient, curious.

### 2. Design contradictions intentionally
- Perfect humans are not interesting.
- Set one desire or weakness that conflicts with their values.
- This contradiction becomes the driving force of the story.

### 3. Value specific details
- Instead of "kind," say "always feeds stray cats when they see them."
- Instead of "smart," say "always uses analogies in conversation."
- Make it concrete enough for the reader to "see."

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes and Countermeasures

### Mistake 1: Setting Overload Syndrome
**Symptom**: Too many settings, AI can't process them all.
**Countermeasure**:
- Be mindful of the 3-layer structure and clarify the role of each layer.
- Keep the immutable core to the bare essentials.
- Reveal details gradually within the story.

### Mistake 2: Loss of Consistency
**Symptom**: Personality changes from scene to scene.
**Countermeasure**:
- Reread CHARACTER.md before writing each scene.
- Include the character's values in the prompt before important conversations.
- Use the consistency checklist periodically.

### Mistake 3: Explanatory Character
**Symptom**: More explanation than action.
**Countermeasure**:
- The principle of "show, don't tell."
- Show character personality through actions.
- Keep explanations of inner thoughts to a minimum.

## 💡 Practical Techniques

### Technique 1: Reverse Engineering
Analyze existing compelling characters:
1. Choose one character you like.
2. Identify that character's core value.
3. Analyze what contradictions they possess.
4. Apply it to your own character.

### Technique 2: Utilizing Constraints
Intentionally set constraints:
- A character who "never lies."
- A character who "cannot speak more than three words consecutively."
- Constraints create personality and drama.

### Technique 3: Establishing Character Voice
1. Create a vocabulary list specific to that character.
2. Also create a list of words they absolutely never use.
3. Decide on three characteristic phrases.
4. Be mindful of these in all their dialogue.

## 🎭 What Can Change, What Must Not Be Blurred

### The "Core" That Must Not Be Blurred
The essential parts of a character need to be consistent throughout the story.

#### Elements to Absolutely Protect
1. **Motivation for Action**
   - Why the character acts
   - Agreement with the reader
   - Basis for empathy

2. **Core Value**
   - Basis for judgment
   - Source of "likeness"
   - Center of identity

3. **Fundamental Nature**
   - Things the character "will never do"
   - Things the character "will always do"
   - Within the range of not betraying reader expectations

#### Why Protect the "Core"?
- To maintain reader trust
- To maintain character persuasiveness
- To ensure story consistency

### Parts That Can Be Changed (Adjust with a live feel)
There are elements that can be flexibly changed according to the story's development.

#### Changeable According to Situation
1. **Superficial Characteristics**
   - Clothing and hairstyle
   - Strength of tone (basic tone maintained)
   - Details of hobbies and preferences

2. **Relationship Development**
   - Distance with other characters
   - Changes in trust level
   - Formation of new bonds

3. **Abilities and Knowledge**
   - Ability improvement through growth
   - Wisdom gained from experience
   - Acquisition of new skills

#### Guidelines for Change
```
Good change: Natural development based on motivation
Bad change: Convenient change contradicting motivation
```

### Practical Example: Character Growth and Consistency

#### Case 1: A cowardly character becomes brave
**❌ Bad Example**
```
Chapter 1: Extremely cowardly
Chapter 2: Suddenly becomes brave (no explanation)
```

**✅ Good Example**
```
Chapter 1: Cowardly, but motivated by "wanting to protect friends"
Chapter 2: Fights fear and takes a step forward for friends
Chapter 3: Accumulates small successful experiences
Chapter 4: Still scared, but able to act
```

#### Case 2: Development from Personal History
**Initial Setting (Personal History)**
- Fear: Acrophobia
- Hobby: Reading

**Development in Story**
```
Problem: Combat at a high place is necessary for the climax
Solution: Maintain acrophobia, but depict a moment where motivation (protecting someone important) overcomes fear
→ Create a moving scene while protecting the character's "core"
```

### Checklist: Criteria for Change
- [ ] Can this change be explained by motivation?
- [ ] Does it not betray reader expectations?
- [ ] Is it natural as character growth?
- [ ] Is "likeness" maintained?
- [ ] Is there a narrative necessity?

### Adjusting with Editors
When receiving feedback like "this type of character is popular recently":

1. **First, check motivation**: Does the suggestion contradict the motivation?
2. **Incorporate partially**: Try with superficial elements first.
3. **Adjust gradually**: Avoid sudden changes.
4. **Reader test**: Fine-tune while observing reactions.

### 💡 Remember
> Even if you grow attached to a character, you need the courage to stick to their "likeness" as "this kind of person." That is sincerity towards the reader.

## 🔄 Improvement Cycle

### After each session:
1. **Record what went well**
   - Which prompts were effective
   - Moments when the character came to life

2. **Identify areas for improvement**
   - Where consistency broke down
   - Actions or statements that felt unnatural

3. **Update CHARACTER.md**
   - Add newly discovered characteristics
   - Remove unnecessary settings
   - Revise for clearer expression

## 🎭 Creating Character Correlation Diagrams

When handling multiple characters:

### Correlation Diagram Template
```
[Character A]
    ↓ 
"Relationship: Specific emotion"
    ↓
[Character B]
```

### Deepening Relationships
1. Compare the values of each character.
2. Clarify points of agreement and conflict.
3. Design the chemical reaction created by these differences.

## 📊 Measuring Effectiveness

### Character Completeness Check
- [ ] Can you answer 10 questions about them instantly?
- [ ] Can you predict their actions even in unexpected situations?
- [ ] Can you explain them to others and be understood?
- [ ] Can you write the same character even after a month?

### Reader Test
- Ask them to list three characteristics of the character.
- Ask about memorable lines or actions.
- Confirm whether they could empathize.

## 🚀 To the Next Level

### Advanced Techniques
1. **Sub-persona**: A different face shown depending on the situation.
2. **Growth arc**: Values are maintained, but expression methods change.
3. **Change due to relationships**: Aspects shown only when with a specific person.

### Master Level
- Can describe the character's dreams.
- Can depict their appearance 10 or 20 years later.
- Can have an improvised conversation as that character.

💭 **Remember**: A character is not a collection of settings, but a living human. Value human-like imperfection over perfect settings.
