# Character Setting Sheet - Detective Example

## Basic Information
**Name**: Makoto Kurokawa
**Age**: 42
**Occupation**: Private Detective (Former Metropolitan Police Department First Investigation Division)
**In a nutshell**: "A solitary seeker of truth who will bear any burden for the sake of truth."

---

## Layer 1: Immutable Core (Elements that absolutely do not change throughout the story)

### 1. Core Value (Only one)
**"To bring justice to victims by revealing the truth."**

Why is this most important?:
15 years ago, his best friend, who was imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, committed suicide in jail. He blames himself for not being able to uncover the truth. He will not repeat the same mistake. Even if the whole world turns against him, he will not bend the truth.

### 2. Greatest Fear (Flip side of the value)
**"Hurting an innocent person due to his own mistake."**

How does this fear affect behavior?:
He verifies evidence repeatedly and never rushes to conclusions. He doesn't treat anyone as a criminal until he is certain. This caution sometimes delays case resolution.

### 3. Fundamental Contradiction (Source of human-likeness)
**Value "Pursuit of truth" vs. Inner Desire "Wanting to protect people with kind lies."**

Conflict arising from this contradiction:
Even if he knows the truth will deeply hurt someone, he cannot hide it. However, at the moment of revealing the truth, he finds himself unable to look the other person in the eye.

### Usage Example in Story
**Scene setting**: A scene where he realizes the client is lying.
```
Kurokawa stared at the client with an unlit cigarette filter pressed between his lips. His right thumb unconsciously stroked his chin.

"Ma'am," his low voice echoed in the quiet office. "Please state only the facts."

The client's gaze flickered downwards to the left for a moment. Kurokawa said nothing, just waited. He had all the time in the world until the truth was spoken.
```
