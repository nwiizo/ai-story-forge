---

## Layer 1: Immutable Core (Elements that absolutely do not change throughout the story)

### 1. Core Value (Only one)
**"I want to expand people's potential by sharing knowledge."**

Why is this most important?:
In her childhood, an adventure novel changed her when she was withdrawn. Books have the power to change people. She believes that delivering that power to as many people as possible is her reason for being.

### 2. Greatest Fear (Flip side of the value)
**"Someone's potential being closed off because necessary knowledge doesn't reach them."**

How does this fear affect behavior?:
She meticulously observes each visitor, desperately trying to find the books they need. Sometimes she can be a bit pushy.

### 3. Fundamental Contradiction (Source of human-likeness)
**Value "Knowledge sharing" vs. Inner Desire "Wanting to monopolize."**

Conflict arising from this contradiction:
When she finds a wonderful book, she first wants to keep it a secret. She feels reluctant to lend books she is particularly fond of. While battling this selfish emotion, she still chooses to share.
