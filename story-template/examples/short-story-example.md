- Letter: 3 sheets of letter paper, written with a fountain pen
- Bookstore: "Tanaka Shoten," a small shop established 50 years ago

### Foreshadowing

- The "special customer" her mother often talked about was the old woman.
- The date on the letter is the day before her mother passed away.

### Example Dialogue
Old Woman: "Haruko used to say, 'Books are bridges that connect people.'"
Misaki: "Mother... loved this store until the very end, didn't she?"

### Example Instructions for AI
```
Write the scene where Misaki and the old woman first meet.
- Misaki is tired but responds politely.
- The old woman is hesitant but has a firm purpose.
- Emphasize the dim atmosphere of the bookstore.
- Express the mysterious sense of closeness flowing between them.
```

### Points to Note During Writing
1. Don't be overly sentimental - aim for restrained emotion.
2. Don't be explanatory - express emotions through actions and expressions.
3. Let the mother's character emerge from the letter and the old woman's words.
4. Aim for a hopeful ending, but avoid an overly simplistic resolution.
