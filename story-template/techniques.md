# Story Creation Technique Collection

## 🎨 Story Creation Techniques in the AI Era

### Why is AI Suited for Story Creation?
1. **Infinite Idea Generation**: Can explore possibilities without constraints.
2. **Objective Perspective**: Frees from the author's biases.
3. **Rapid Trial and Error**: Instantly compare multiple versions.
4. **Consistency Maintenance**: Perfect memory that doesn't forget settings.

### Creating with an Understanding of AI's Limitations
1. **Lost in the Middle Phenomenon**: Tends to forget the middle part of long texts.
2. **Physical Contradictions**: Struggles with spatial awareness.
3. **Subtle Emotional Expression**: Understanding complex human psychology.
4. **Limits of Originality**: Combination of existing patterns.

## 📐 Structural Approaches

### 1. Snowflake Method x AI
```
Core: Express the story in one sentence
  ↓
Expansion: Expand the sentence into a paragraph
  ↓
Detail: Expand the paragraph into chapters
  ↓
Specifics: Expand chapters into scenes
```

**AI Prompt Example**:
```
Expand the story "A lonely girl discovers her own worth through friendship"
using the Snowflake Method.
First, expand into three paragraphs,
then divide each paragraph into three chapters.
```

### 2. Scene Card Method
Create each scene as an independent card and combine them later.

**Card Content**:
- Purpose of the scene
- Characters present
- Emotional changes
- Foreshadowing for the next part

**Advantages**:
- Easy to reorder
- Simple to delete unnecessary scenes
- Allows AI to focus on each scene

### 3. Emotion Graph Method
```
Emotion Level
10 |    ★
 8 |   / \
 6 |  /   \  ★
 4 | /     \/
 2 |★      
 0 |____________
   Start Middle End
```

Set events at each point and design emotional fluctuations.

## 🔧 Practical Techniques

### Technique 1: Prompt Chaining
Sequential creation using the previous output as the next input.

```
1. Character creation
    ↓ (Utilize result)
2. Plot creation with that character
    ↓ (Utilize result)
3. Extraction of important scenes from the plot
    ↓ (Utilize result)
4. Detailing each scene
```

### Technique 2: Parallel Generation
Generate multiple versions with the same prompt and combine the good parts.

```
Version A: Emotion-focused
Version B: Action-focused
Version C: Dialogue-focused
→ Integrate the good parts of each version
```

### Technique 3: Constraint Creativity
Draw out creativity by intentionally setting strict constraints.

**Examples of Constraints**:
- Express one chapter in 100 characters
- Describe a scene with only 5 words
- The protagonist does not speak a single word

## 🎭 Character-Driven Story

### Drama Born from Conflict
```
Character A: Value X
      VS
Character B: Value Y

This conflict drives the story
```

**Prompt Example**:
```
Construct a family drama
born from the value conflict between
a "perfectionist older brother" and a "free-spirited younger sister."
```

### Externalizing Internal Conflict
Express a character's internal conflict as an external event.

**Example**:
- Internal conflict: Lack of confidence
- Externalization: Failure in an important presentation
- Development: Growth in the process of overcoming failure

## 📝 Style and Tone

### Maintaining Stylistic Consistency
**Elements to include in the initial prompt**:
1. Example sentences of the desired style.
2. List of expressions to avoid.
3. Keywords for the target atmosphere.

### Style by Genre
**Mystery**:
- Objective and calm descriptions.
- Attention to detail.
- Logical sentence structure.

**Romance Novel**:
- Emotionally rich descriptions.
- Subtle changes in inner thoughts.
- Frequent use of metaphors.

**Fantasy**:
- Grand and poetic descriptions.
- Effective use of neologisms.
- Style that evokes the world view.

## 🚀 Productivity Improvement Techniques

### Batch Processing
Process similar tasks together:
1. All character settings at once.
2. Synopses of all chapters at once.
3. Beginnings of all scenes at once.

### Utilizing Templates
```
Scene Template:
【Location】:
【Time】:
【Characters Present】:
【Purpose】: What to achieve in this scene
【Beginning】: First sentence
【Development】: Expand in 3-5 sentences
【Conclusion】: Closing sentence
【Bridge to Next】:
```

### Revision Strategy
1. **First Draft**: Focus on structure and plot.
2. **Second Draft**: Character consistency.
3. **Third Draft**: Refinement of style and expression.
4. **Final Draft**: Fine-tuning details.

## 💡 Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

**Problem 1: Sagging Middle**
- Solution: Add a subplot.

**Problem 2: Character Lacks Presence**

3. Does the **climax** exceed expectations?
4. Does the **ending** provide satisfaction?
