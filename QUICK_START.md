```

### 2-2. Fill in basic information
First, please fill in only the following 4 items:
- Name
- Age
- Occupation
- In a nutshell

### 2-3. Deepen the character through dialogue with AI

#### If you are using Claude Code
```bash
# Create a new character
/character new

# Or develop a specific character
/character develop Asuka Sato
```

#### For other AI tools
Copy Step 1 from `character-prompts.md` and paste it into your AI tool (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):

```
Please set only one most important value for the following person.

[Basic Settings]

Enter the AI's response in the "Core Value" section of `CHARACTER.md`.

## üéØ Step 3: Create a simple story outline (1 minute)

### If you are using Claude Code
```bash
# Construct a story by specifying the title
/story plot "The Last Letter"

# Or start in interactive mode
/story
```

### For other AI tools
Ask the AI the following:

```
Character: [Summary of the created character]

I want to create a short story with this character as the protagonist.
1. What kind of daily life does it start from? (1 line)
2. What kind of event will occur? (1 line)

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Which AI tool is recommended?
A: **Claude Code** allows you to work efficiently with dedicated commands. Otherwise, **Claude Opus 4** is recommended for long text processing, and **ChatGPT** for short dialogues.

### Q: What if the character becomes inconsistent?
A: Return to the "Core Value" in CHARACTER.md. All actions stem from this value.

### Q: What if the story gets stuck?
A: Concentrate on only three important scenes (turning point, emotional peak, theme embodiment) and leave others for later.

## üéâ Tips for Success

1. **Don't aim for perfection** - You can always revise later
2. **Start small** - Try writing just one scene first
3. **Enjoy dialogues with AI** - Unexpected answers are also a source of creativity
4. **Reflect periodically** - Record prompts that worked well
5. **Utilize commands** - With Claude Code, use `/` for efficiency
