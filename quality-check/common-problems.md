# Common Problems and Countermeasures

## 1. Character Consistency Collapse
**Symptom**: Actions contradicting values, sudden personality changes.
**Cause**: Inability to process multiple constraints simultaneously.
**Countermeasure**:
- Narrow down to one core value.
- Depict changes gradually.
- Perform consistency checks after each scene.

### Specific Example and Correction

**‚ùå Bad Example**
```
Misaki is a librarian who cherishes books.
‚Üí In the next scene, she handles books roughly.
```

**‚úÖ Good Example**
```
Misaki is a librarian who cherishes books.
‚Üí Even when emotional, she places books down carefully.
‚Üí Afterwards, she regrets her actions.
```

### Countermeasure in Prompts
```
This character's core value is "knowledge sharing."
All actions derive from this value.
Even when emotional, this value is upheld.
```

## 2. Breakdown of Physical Laws
**Symptom**: Impossible movements, contradictory positional relationships.
**Cause**: Limitations in spatial awareness.
**Countermeasure**:
- Minimize physical descriptions.
- Focus on psychological descriptions.
- Keep location settings simple.

### Specific Example and Correction

**‚ùå Bad Example**
```
Moved from the first-floor bookstore to a second-floor room and looked down at the first-floor garden from the window.
```

**‚úÖ Good Example**
```
Left the bookstore and headed to an office on the second floor of the adjacent building.
From the window, the sign of the bookstore they were just in was visible.
```

### Simple Spatial Settings
- Limit locations to a maximum of three.
- Describe movements clearly.
- Avoid complex building structures.

## 3. Unnatural Emotional Changes
**Symptom**: Sudden changes of heart, unexplained emotional shifts.
**Cause**: "Lost in the Middle" phenomenon.
**Countermeasure**:
- Establish important emotions at the beginning.
- Carefully depict the process of change.
- Clearly show internal conflicts.

### Depicting Gradual Emotional Changes

**‚ùå Bad Example**
```
Was furious ‚Üí Suddenly forgives
```

**‚úÖ Good Example**
```
Furious ‚Üí Learns the other person's circumstances ‚Üí Agitated ‚Üí Relates to oneself ‚Üí Understands ‚Üí Forgives
```

### Emotional Change Template
1. Trigger (external factor)
2. Internal realization
3. Conflict
4. Decision
5. New emotional state

## 4. Excessive Explanation
**Symptom**: Explaining everything, more explanation than action.
**Cause**: Prioritizing "telling" too much.
**Countermeasure**:
- Show > Tell
- Leave it to the reader's imagination.
- Provide only the necessary minimum information.

### Practicing Show, Don't Tell

**‚ùå Bad Example**
```
Misaki was sad. She was so sad, she felt like crying.
She remembered her mother, and her chest ached.
```

**‚úÖ Good Example**
```
Misaki gently stroked the spine of the book.
The last book her mother had stocked. Her fingertips trembled faintly.
```

## 5. Lost in the Middle Countermeasures

### Understanding the Problem
AI tends to forget information in the middle of long texts.

### Countermeasure 1: Placement of Important Information
```
Structure:
1. Beginning: Core settings
2. Middle: Development and depiction
3. End: Important conclusions or changes
```

### Countermeasure 2: Periodic Reminders
```
Every 3-5 paragraphs:
- Show character values through actions.
- Casually repeat important settings.
- Place foreshadowing incrementally.
```

## 6. Unnatural Dialogue

### Common Problems
- Everyone speaks the same way.
- Overly explanatory conversations.
- Statements uncharacteristic of the speaker.

### Dialogue Differentiation Techniques

**Character A (Polite)**
```
"I do apologize. Regarding that book, I will check the inventory."
```

**Character B (Casual)**
```
"Oh, that book? Hang on, I'll go check if it's in stock."
```

**Character C (Authoritative)**
```
"That book, you say. I shall have someone confirm whether it is in stock."
```

## 7. Pacing Problems

### Symptoms
- First half is too long.
- Climax feels rushed.
- Ending is abrupt.

### Ideal Distribution (for short stories)
- Introduction: 20%
- Development: 50%
- Climax: 20%
- Conclusion: 10%

## 8. Foreshadowing Mistakes

### Common Failures
1. Too much foreshadowing, some is forgotten/not resolved.
2. Foreshadowing is too obvious.
3. Important facts appear without prior foreshadowing.

### Foreshadowing Management Table
```
| Foreshadowing | Appears in Ch. | Resolved in Ch. | Importance |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Letter        | 1              | 8               | High       |
| Key           | 3              | 7               | Medium     |
```

## 9. AI Prompt Optimization

### Problematic Prompt
```
"Write a moving scene."
```

### Improved Prompt
```
Scene: Misaki reads her mother's letter
Location: Dimly lit bookstore counter
Time: Silence after closing
Emotion: Surprise ‚Üí Understanding ‚Üí Quiet tears
Length: Around 500 characters
Note: Avoid explanation; express emotion through actions and scenery.
```

## 10. Genre-Specific Points to Note

### Mystery
- Present clues fairly.
- Within a range the reader can deduce.
- Avoid supernatural solutions.

### Romance Novel
- Depict emotional subtleties carefully.
- Obstacles should be realistic.
- Value the process leading to mutual affection.

### Fantasy
- Keep world-building rules consistent.
- Avoid convenient magic.
- Don't forget human drama.
